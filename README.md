### General Description
The program’s main objective is to encrypt and decrypt a message that is provided by a user using the Vigenere Cipher method. It’s a secure alternative to simple ciphers like the Caesar Cipher method. The Vigenere Cipher method uses polyalphabetic substitution technique which means that each letter in the plaintext can be substituted by multiple different letters in the ciphertext, depending on its position and the corresponding letter in the associated key. 

### Instructions
First, load and run the file. Then, follow the on-screen instructions on inputting an encrypted message then a decrypted message.
